/**
 * Testing Instructions:
 * 
 * 1. Log in as an admin user
 * 2. Navigate to /admin/test-user-display
 * 3. For each user role in the test cases:
 *    a. Select a user with that role
 *    b. Verify that the UI matches all expectations in the list
 *    c. Check that data displayed is appropriate for that user
 * 4. Check loading states by throttling network in dev tools
 * 5. Verify error handling by temporarily breaking API endpoints
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - The homepage info box should adapt its content and appearance based on user role
 * - All data displayed should be relevant to the specific user
 * - UI should handle loading and error states gracefully
